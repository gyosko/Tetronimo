#Tetronimo#

Tetronimo is a simple tetris clone I made to experiment with Python.

I've uploaded it to Github so anyone who'd like can improve it.


If you want to try it,but you don't have Python 3.3 and Pygame on your system you can grab the Windows Installer under 
win32installer.

###Dependencies###

You can do whatever you want with this code.
I'm writing this paragraph only because I've just read [this article](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/pick-a-license-any-license.html).
